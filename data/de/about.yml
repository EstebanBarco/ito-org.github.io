  <b>ito</b> is built by people like you. We merged from several teams that participated in the #WirVsVirus Hackathon in March 2020. 
  We have since been joined by many other interested professionals and companies.
  We all know how important this project is right now, because privacy is sacred even in times of crisis. 
  It is necessary to form a common front and avoid fragmentation. That's why we have all come together under <b>ito</b>  and continue to work on it.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's not all! <b>ito</b> is currently actively forming a global alliance of privacy-focused open source projects working decentralized tracing solutions. 
  The goal of this work is to create a unanimous privacy-protecting protocol that different countires and institutions can build thir contact tracing apps on.

      Not every solution is created by people who are paid for it, ito  is one of those. We all work pro-bono and voluntarily to help society handle this outbreak. 
      Nothing will happen if nobody fights for it, that is the reason why we all found each other. 
      Global interoperability of COVID19 contact tracing protocols is crucial, and we are working to achieve this.
      Our team thinks globally and is ready to do more.

    description: > 
      We want a free solution for anyone and everyone. COVID19 knows no boundaries and nor do we. 
      Therefore we have to go beyond all these boundaries and local solutions and work together to find a global one. 
      ito  is currently in the process of forming a global alliance with privacy-focused open source projects. If you're interested, get in touch and join us!
