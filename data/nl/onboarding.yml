title   : How you can support us
description: >
  <p>
    We are open to any kind of support. Right now we especially are looking for iOS Developers (Bluetooth/BLE knowledge would be a gift).
  </p>
  <p>
    But every other hand is needed and welcomed.
  </p>
  <p>
    To get a first glimpse of what our current status is right now, check out the org at <a href="https://github.com/ito-org/" target="_blank">github</a>.<br />
  </p>
  <p>To read something about the current project status head over to our <a href="https://confluence.ito-app.org/" target="_blank">confluence page</a><br />
    But please be aware that right now we don't have the time to make everything structured and pretty. (Maybe you want to help there?)
    </p>
  <p>
    To get working with us, head over to our <a href="https://discord.gg/GbSySkC" target="_blank">discord channel</a>.
    Please say hello in the #onboarding channel and give a small overview over your skillset in the #skillset channel. Have a look at the pinned messages and talk to the leads (see the user list on the right for them) about where you can and want to help.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are related to the press or want to outreach to the public in any other way, the simplest way to get in touch is through <a href="mailto:presse@ito-app.org">presse@ito-app.org</a>
